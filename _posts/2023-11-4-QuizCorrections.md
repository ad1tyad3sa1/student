## Question 1

![Question 1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/795744270732099634/1170925932308070420/question1.png?ex=655ad0c1&is=65485bc1&hm=24a75f661cacadc85bfcc07eeaecbd2f37c64ce825028732ee6d718e25cde0d0&)

Answer: I answered temp = first, but this is clearly wrong because values that are interchanged are first and second within temp, therefore setting second = temp will correctly represent swapping the values.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 14

![Question 14](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/795744270732099634/1170926179189010492/question14.png?ex=655ad0fb&is=65485bfb  hm=a8354deaf0fe57ff3338ca2dc75dc67276283f910c930ee48408a3b49e16350d&)

Answer: Interchanging the display block with the operation of adding 1 will keep the number of values outputted the same but each value will be 1 greater in Program B. Program B would output numbers 2-11 while A would produce numbers 1-10. Therefore the answer choice "Program A and program B display the same number of values, but the values differ" is correct over Program A and program B display identical values.

## Question 31

![Question 31](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/795744270732099634/1170926997451579463/question_31.png?ex=655ad1be&is=65485cbe&hm=4d859be8b2f3cbdd7ab922858e26ce0db09e8aa8f70ffedfdb89e7f972ecab2e&)

Answer: I failed to look at this problem closely realizing that both solutions helped the robot reach the desired location. Program 1 takes the robot in a L shape pattern until it ends up on the shaded box. Program 2 takes the robot to the top right corner before it turns and takes it to the destination.

## Question 44

![Question 44](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/795744270732099634/1170929117995212900/question_44.png?ex=655ad3b8&is=65485eb8&hm=6c770b86767e5cf4a9b82130a2a62af35fb7b48425eb54e5272d9783d8c8fab1&)

Answer: An overflow error occurs when the output is not in a defined number of possibilities. A four bit representation contains 2^4 or 16 numbers from 0-15. Since 7+10=17 and is the only number in the options out of that range, it is the solution. I misunderstood the concept of a overflow error and what a 4 bit representation was.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 46

![Question 46](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1085799995548106872/1170943550716923924/question_46.png?ex=655ae129&is=65486c29&hm=9c2a0389762da0dc8f8204cd0250dea4a06b2e2c80c77b7fcd5dc8ba485d6e93&)

Answer: An undecidable problem by definition is something in which no algorithm can be constructed that always leads to a correct yes-or-no answer. Therefore it is not possible to create an algorithm that will solve the problem for all programs and inputs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 65

![Question 65](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1085799995548106872/1170945231424868432/q65.png?ex=655ae2ba&is=65486dba&hm=8f56ce818a004f97a34fd56ac9a9221533fc1afa32895998780d63b72f8aaad7&)

Answer: Based on the code segment above, whenever the value of y is negative, a wrong output will be displayed. This is because the condition count equals y will never be met (when y is negative) since count begins at 0 and repeatedly increases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Question 66

![Question 66](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1085799995548106872/1170950429606150176/q66.png?ex=655ae791&is=65487291&hm=8aaaafbf9030f3cf3256e9841e896c2ba7a7487a23ddc7b6e9e98dbd95a68e3c&)

Answer: The procedure returns the first number it encounters that is less than the first number in the list. Therefore if the second number is not the min, the procedure won't work.
